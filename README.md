# P5.js-simple-spaceship-game
<br/>
<h2>basic p5.js</h2>
<p>
  This is a simple "breakout" style game made using the p5.js library.<br/><br/> In this game, player will control their character (a paddle at the bottom of the screen) using the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong> keys on the keyboard (A=left, D=right). A ball will be also be moving around the board - the ball is designed to move at a fixed speed in one direction until it reaches an edge or the paddle - once it hits one of these items it will "bounce" in the opposite direction. 
  <br/><br/>The goal of the game is to <strong>direct the ball to hit a randomly positioned item on the board</strong> - doing so earns a point, and the item is repositioned somewhere else on the board.
